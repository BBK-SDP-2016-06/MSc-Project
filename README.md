# MSc-Project

My attempt at creating a classification model for labelling time series data samples. It makes use of the k-nearest neighbour algorithm 
and the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem as a similarity measure. This project was undertaken as part of the MSc Computer Science
programme at Birkbeck College, summer 2016.
